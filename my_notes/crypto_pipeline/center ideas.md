# 1 — Architecture (high level)

Producer (live data)

- Python script fetching Binance (REST + WebSocket) → serializes messages → pushes to **Kafka** topics.
    

Streaming layer

- **Kafka** (Zookeeper) holds live stream.
    
- Optionally **RabbitMQ** can be used for lightweight job distribution (e.g., notification workers).
    

Stream consumers / processing

- **Spark Structured Streaming** reads from Kafka (local mode) → transforms → writes to:
    
    - **PostgreSQL** (fact/summary tables, business queries)
        
    - **Cassandra** (wide-row/time series for high write throughput — column store)
        
    - **Parquet** files on HDFS (or MinIO) managed by **lakeFS** (data lake)
        
    - **InfluxDB** for specialized time-series data (metric charts)
        
    - **MongoDB** (document store for raw messages + enrichment)
        
    - **Elasticsearch** for full-text search / quick queries and dashboards (ELK/Kibana)
        

Supporting systems

- **Redis**: caching aggregated metrics & API cache for dashboard.
    
- **Neo4j**: graph store for relationships (exchanges, pairs, wallets, users).
    
- **Apache Geode**: distributed in-memory grid for derived shared state (can be single-node in dev).
    
- **HDFS**: single-node (stores Parquet files for batch processing / Hive like queries).
    
- **lakeFS**: layer over object store (MinIO) for versioning & reproducible data lake.
    
- **ELK**: Filebeat/Logstash → Elasticsearch → Kibana for logs and pipeline debugging.
    
- **Prometheus** + **Grafana**: metrics & system dashboards.
    
- **Metabase** + **Seaborn**: business dashboards and data exploration.
    
- **Docker**: containerize everything and orchestrate locally with `docker-compose`.
    

Data flow summary:  
Binance → Kafka → (Spark streaming / consumers) → Parquet(HDFS)/Postgres/Cassandra/Mongo/ES/Influx → Dashboards (Metabase, Grafana, Kibana)  
Redis/Geode/Neo4j are used for fast lookups, caching and relationship queries.

# 2 — Implementation plan (milestones)

Follow these phases (I recommend 8–10 days per phase if you want a 2–3 month project — adjust speed as you like).

[[Phase A]] — Essentials (Day 1–5)

1. Pick local environment and install Docker/Docker Compose.
    
2. Run a minimal stack: Kafka+Zookeeper, Postgres, Redis, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, MinIO, InfluxDB, Neo4j, Cassandra (single node), Metabase, Prometheus, Grafana, HDFS single node, lakeFS (pointing at MinIO).
    
3. Verify each service is reachable.
    

Phase B — Ingest (Day 6–12)

1. Build a Python Kafka producer that streams Binance ticker/aggTrade events (or REST polling if WebSocket blocked).
    
2. Produce to Kafka topic `crypto.trades` or `crypto.ticks`. Include timestamp, symbol, price, qty, side, exchange, raw message.
    

Phase C — Streaming ETL (Day 13–20)

1. Spark Structured Streaming job reading Kafka (local mode) performing cleaning and enrichment (e.g., normalize symbol, convert timestamp to UTC, compute VWAP window).
    
2. Write streaming output to:
    
    - Parquet files (HDFS path) partitioned by date/hour (managed by lakeFS).
        
    - PostgreSQL (small aggregates: minute OHLC per symbol).
        
    - InfluxDB for high-resolution time series.
        

Phase D — Storage & Indexing (Day 21–28)

1. Insert raw/enriched docs into MongoDB.
    
2. Index essential fields into Elasticsearch for fast searches and visualizations.
    
3. Batch write high-throughput timeseries into Cassandra (time bucketing).
    

Phase E — Caching, Graph & Distributed state (Day 29–35)

1. Put frequently queried summaries into Redis (e.g., latest price per symbol, 1-min moving avg).
    
2. Model relationships (user wallets/trades/pairs/exchanges) and import small sample graph into Neo4j.
    
3. Introduce Apache Geode for shared in-memory derived state where appropriate (dev single-node).
    

Phase F — Observability, Logging & Dashboards (Day 36–45)

1. Ship logs to ELK (Filebeat -> Logstash-> Elasticsearch), build Kibana dashboards for pipeline logs and failures.
    
2. Configure Prometheus exporters for Postgres, Kafka, Cassandra, and Spark. Build Grafana dashboards.
    
3. Build Metabase dashboards over PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch. Use seaborn for deeper local plots in Jupyter.
    

Phase G — Batch jobs & versioned lake (Day 46–55)

1. Run periodic Spark batch jobs (Hadoop MapReduce example if you want) reading Parquet from HDFS to create historical aggregates.
    
2. Use lakeFS for commit/branching of datasets (e.g., `main` vs `experiments/my-feature`).
    
3. Demonstrate rollbacks and reproducibility.
    

Phase H — Demo & polish (Day 56–65)

1. Hold demo: live price dashboard (Grafana), queryable dataset in Metabase, search in Kibana, graph in Neo4j browser.
    
2. Document architecture + Docker Compose + runbook. Create a README + short screencast.

# 3 — How to run this on a limited laptop

- Run everything with **reduced resources**: limit container memory, run single node mode, reduce retention & partition counts in Kafka.
    
- Use **sampling**: produce only every 5s or 30s; you still get a live pipeline.
    
- Use **local Spark** (not cluster) and small partitions.
    
- Offload heavy storage to **MinIO** (object store) instead of full HDFS cluster; use lakeFS over MinIO.
    
- Use **Redpanda** (Kafka-compatible) as a lighter alternative if Kafka is heavy — but you asked for Kafka; it’s fine in dev.
    
- Start small: producer + kafka + spark + postgres + metabase. Add other services gradually.

# 4 — Demo ideas 

1. Live dashboard (Grafana) showing latest price & 1-minute/5-minute moving average and volume.
    
2. Metabase dashboard: historical OHLC, top movers, volatility table.
    
3. Kibana: errors & processing latency traces.
    
4. Neo4j graph: relationships between exchanges/pairs/wallets or KYC sample dataset.
    
5. Notebook (Jupyter) with seaborn visualizations and reproducible Spark batch job that computes monthly aggregates from Parquet dataset in lakeFS.
    
6. README + `docker-compose up` instructions + scripts to seed sample data.

# 5 — Extra tips & gotchas

- **Schema evolution**: store raw messages in Mongo or raw Parquet as immutable source; write schema-aware ETL (use Avro/Protobuf when you need strong schemas). You requested Parquet — use it for columnar storage and efficient reads.
    
- **Backpressure & Kafka retention**: set sensible retention and compaction for topics to avoid disk fill.
    
- **Transactions**: writes into multiple systems require idempotency (include unique event ids).
    
- **Testing**: use tiny synthetic data locally and a “replay” mode to reprocess historical data.
    
- **Security**: bind services to localhost during dev; don’t expose credentials.
